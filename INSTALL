Installation
============

The file ps.F first needs to be compiled separately to generate tme module file "ps.mod".  Any plotting program to use the library can then be compiled, either by adding the file ps.o directly or by placing ps.o in a library.


1.  Case without using library
==============================

Using a linux bash shell with the gfortran compiler:

  gfortran -c ps.F                            <- generate ps.o and ps.mod
  gfortran -o plot1 plot1.F ps.o              <- generate plot1
  ./plot1                                     <- run plot1

2.  Compile the routines as a library
=====================================

Using a linux bash shell with the gfortran compiler:

  gfortran -c ps.F                            <- generate ps.o and ps.mod
  ar -crv libps.a ps.o                        <- generate library libps.a

  sudo cp libps.a  LIB      <= LIB a suitable library directory i.e. /usr/local/lib64
  sudo cp ps.mod   INC      <= INC a suitable include directory, i.e. /usr/local/include

If the files are copied to the users own library and include directories the sudo command at the start of these line should be left out.  If /home/me is the users home directory then the value of LIB would be /home/me/lib64 and INC would be /home/me/include

A plotting program should always use the 'use PS' line.  If a library is used, the compile command needs '-lps' added:

   gfortran -o plot1 plot1.F -lps
   ./plot1

If the LIB and INC directories are not standard ones, they may need to be specified as part of the compile command:
   gfortran -o plot1 plot1.F -I/home/me/include -L/home/nme/lib64

3.  The plotting program

This should have the form:
------------------------------------
      program plot1
      use ps
      implicit none

      ...  part of program

      call psinit("a4h","POST.eps")

      ...  plotting commands

      call showpage
      call psclose

      ... rest of program

      end program plot1
----------------------------------
